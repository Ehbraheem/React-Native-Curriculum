## Notes
The goal here is to give you just enough guidance for you to struggle without drowning. Note that the steps below are just suggestions. The ideal situation is you look at the completed project, then you build it. However, if you're not up for such things, feel free to follow the (vague by design) steps below. If you get stuck, all steps have coinciding branches for you to reference as a last case scenario.

##Step 0: Examine the Final Product
 * You'll be building the app in the GIF above. Get familiar with it's functionality, the different route transitions, how it differs on iOS and Android.

##Step 1: /HelloWorld
Before we dive into building the app, let's just make sure we have a Hello World app working on both Android and iOS.

 * Create a new project using react-native init
 * Create and configure your .babelrc file if you want babel-root-import
 * Create an app directory and in your app directory create and configure your index.js file
 * Have index.android.js and index.ios.js render your 'app/index.js' file
 * Verify your app works on both Android and iOS (if you're building for both platforms)

## Congrats!
If you got through this, great job. If you're reading this and you've made it this far, be proud. This was a pretty advanced project. Take a look at my code and compare to what we did differently.
